# cps-wiki
Community documentation for the CPS project

This repo exists to provide a more accessible wiki for the CPS community to maintain. [You can find that wiki here](https://github.com/cps-org/cps-wiki/wiki/Welcome).

The Common Package Specification itself is versioned and maintained with pull request workflows in [the CPS repo](https://github.com/cps-org/cps).
